# 🚚 Supply Chain Management Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction
This Power BI dashboard project provides a comprehensive overview of supply chain operations. It focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as inventory levels, order fulfillment rates, supplier performance, and transportation efficiency to enable data-driven decision-making.

## 📚 Background
Efficient supply chain management is crucial to minimize costs, meet customer demand, and maintain a competitive advantage. This project aims to:
- Analyze critical components of the supply chain lifecycle
- Monitor supplier reliability and inventory movement
- Identify inefficiencies in order fulfillment and transportation
- Help businesses make strategic decisions through data visualization

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For dashboard design, DAX calculations, and interactive visualization
- **Data Sources**: Structured datasets representing inventory, orders, suppliers, and logistics
- **DAX Measures**: Used to calculate KPIs like On-Time Delivery %, Inventory Turnover Ratio, and Cost per Shipment

## 📊 The Analysis

### 🔹 Dashboard Sections:
1. **Overview**  
   - Total Orders, Shipments, and Inventory Value  
   - Key KPIs like Order Accuracy, On-Time Delivery Rate

2. **Inventory Management**  
   - Inventory turnover rate  
   - Stock by product category and warehouse location  
   - Aging inventory heatmap  

3. **Order Fulfillment**  
   - Fulfillment cycle time  
   - Order status tracking (Pending, Shipped, Delayed)  
   - Customer order fill rate  

4. **Supplier Performance**  
   - Supplier defect rate  
   - On-time delivery by supplier  
   - Cost vs. Quality comparison (scatter plot)  
   - Total cost vs. defect rate visualization

5. **Transportation Efficiency**  
   - Average shipment cost per km  
   - Delivery time by region  
   - On-time delivery trend line  

6. **Supply Chain Costs**  
   - Cost breakdown (Logistics, Procurement, Warehousing)  
   - Monthly trend of total supply chain costs  
   - Cost efficiency scorecard

> 📌 Filters added: Date Range, Product Category, Region, Supplier, Order Status

## 📈 What I Learned
- Power BI allows seamless integration of complex datasets for cross-functional analysis  
- DAX is essential for building dynamic and insightful KPIs  
- Visualizing relationships like *Cost vs. Quality* can guide procurement strategy  
- Proper filter design improves interactivity and usability of dashboards

## 💡 Conclusion & Insights
- Inventory turnover and supplier delivery are major cost drivers  
- High defect rates often correlate with lower-cost suppliers, suggesting trade-offs  
- Order fulfillment delays often occur in specific regions — pointing to logistic bottlenecks  
- Focus areas for improvement: supplier vetting, transportation optimization, and warehouse efficiency

## 🙌 Closing Thoughts
This dashboard empowers supply chain managers with the visibility they need to optimize performance and reduce costs. Future improvements could include:
- Real-time data integration  
- Forecasting demand using machine learning  
- Integrating external datasets (weather, fuel prices)
